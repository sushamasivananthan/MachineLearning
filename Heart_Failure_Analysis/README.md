# Heart Failure Analysis

Using information like age , sex , blood pressure, smoke, diabetes ,ejection fraction , creatinine phosphokinase , serum creatinine , serum sodium and time we have to analyse the and build a model for predicting mortality caused by Heart Failure.

Motivation:

To extract causes of Heart failure from the given data
Explore the data - Data Exploratory Analysis and data visualisazion.
Try to detect and extract relevant feature in order to build a prediction model.

Strategy:

➊ Importing Libraries

➋ Data Pre-Processing

➌ Data Analysis

➍ Build A Machine Learning Model
